wifi-chating
============

we can chat through with our wifi network to any one .. just putting his/her ip address with dummy port no. example :80 or 81... but it will work for only two person at a time communication.
To start communication you just have to manually put the ip address of person system(available in your network). In the blank textbox... an enjoy App :)
